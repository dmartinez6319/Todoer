# Todoer (To-do List Webapp) <br>
Odin Project Series <br>

This project is a task management application that allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks within various projects, with tasks organized by priority (high, medium, low). <br>

The application is built using a modular design, with separate modules for managing projects, todos, rendering the UI, and sorting tasks. It utilizes object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to encapsulate logic within objects like ProjectManager, TodoManager, and PriorityManager. <br>

Webpack is used to bundle and manage assets and modules <br>
